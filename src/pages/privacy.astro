        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">The short version</h2>
          <p>Small Talk is private by design. Your notes are stored on your device, encrypted. We don't have servers, so we can't see your data. We don't have accounts, so we don't know who you are.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">What we collect</h2>
          <p>Nothing. No accounts, no tracking, no analytics. We don't collect personal information, usage data, or device identifiers. We don't know who you are or how you use the app.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">How your data is stored</h2>
          <p>Your notes are stored on your device, encrypted. We don't have servers. There's nothing to hack because there's nothing to steal.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Backup</h2>
          <p>If you enable backup, your data is stored in your own iCloud or Google Drive account. It's encrypted by Apple or Google and protected by your platform account. We never see it, never touch it, and have no access to it.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">You can also export your notes as a file. Once exported, that file is yours to manage — we have no access to it.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">You can disable backup or delete your backups at any time through your device settings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Third-party services</h2>
          <p>We don't use analytics, crash reporting, advertising, or any external services. The only third parties involved are Apple and Google — for the app stores and, if you choose, backup to your own cloud account.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">In-app purchases</h2>
          <p>Small Talk offers a one-time purchase to unlock extra themes and export. Payments are handled entirely by Apple or Google. We never see your payment information.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Data sharing</h2>
          <p>Never. We don't share data because we don't have any. We couldn't share your notes even if we wanted to.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Your control</h2>
          <p>It's your notebook. You can delete any note, any person, or everything at once — anytime. Uninstall the app and all local data is gone. To remove backups, delete them from your iCloud or Google Drive account.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Children's privacy</h2>
          <p>Small Talk is not directed at children under 13. We don't knowingly collect information from children. Since we don't collect information from anyone, this is straightforward.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>If we change this policy, we'll update it here with a new date. That's it. No buried changes, no surprises.</p>
