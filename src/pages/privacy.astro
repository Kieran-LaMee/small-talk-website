        <section>
          <p>This privacy policy applies to the Small Talk Notebook app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, created by Kieran LaMee (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">Small Talk is a <strong>local-first app</strong>. Everything you store in the Application — names, notes, relationships, birthdays — lives exclusively on your device. The Service Provider does not operate servers that receive, store, or process your personal data. This policy explains how your data is handled within the Application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">What data does the Application store, and where does it go?</h2>
          <p>The Application stores the following information on your device:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-5 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>Names, relationship types, and custom fields you create about people</li>
            <li>Birthdays, cities, and workplace or school information</li>
            <li>Free-text notes about people, including note headlines and body content</li>
            <li>Relationships between people (e.g. "sister", "coworker")</li>
            <li>Tags and categories you create</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4">All of this data is stored in an encrypted database on your device only. It is never transmitted to the Service Provider or any external server. The Service Provider has no ability to access, view, or recover your data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Does the Service Provider collect any information?</h2>
          <p>No. The Service Provider does not collect usage data, analytics, crash reports, or any other telemetry. The Application makes no outbound network requests to any developer-controlled server.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">Registration is not required to use the Application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Do third parties see or have access to my data?</h2>
          <p>Your personal data is not shared with third parties. The only external communication the Application performs is:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-5 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> If you purchase Small Talk Plus, the transaction is processed by Apple via StoreKit. The Service Provider does not receive your payment details or Apple ID. <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" class="text-[--color-highlight] underline">Apple's privacy policy</a> governs this interaction.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Data security</h2>
          <p>Your data is protected by AES-256 encryption (SQLCipher). The encryption key is generated on your device at first launch and stored in the iOS Keychain. The Keychain entry is included in encrypted iCloud Keychain backups, which allows your data to transfer securely to a new device.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">The Service Provider never has access to your encryption key or your data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">iCloud device backup</h2>
          <p>The Application's encrypted database is included in standard iOS device backups (iCloud and iTunes/Finder). The database is backed up in its encrypted form — without the corresponding encryption key it cannot be read. The encryption key is stored separately in the iOS Keychain, which is synced via encrypted iCloud Keychain. Together, this means a full device backup and restore will correctly recover your data on a new device, while the backed-up files remain unreadable to anyone without access to both.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Backup and export</h2>
          <p>The Application includes an optional backup feature (available with Small Talk Plus). When you export a backup, a file containing all your personal data is created on your device and surfaced via the iOS share sheet. You choose where it goes — Files, AirDrop, email, or any other destination your device supports. The Service Provider does not receive your backup and has no access to it.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">Backup files are not additionally encrypted beyond whatever protections apply to the destination you choose. You are responsible for storing backups securely.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Data deletion</h2>
          <p>All personal data stored by the Application lives on your device. Uninstalling the Application removes the encrypted database, deleting all your personal data. If you want to preserve your data before uninstalling, you can export a backup first using the backup feature (available with Small Talk Plus).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Notifications</h2>
          <p>The Application can send local notifications for birthday reminders and note reminders, if you choose to enable these features. All notifications are generated entirely on your device — no push notification service or external server is involved.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">Birthday reminder notifications include the person's name. Note reminder notifications may include your note headline or content. This information never leaves your device.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Biometric authentication</h2>
          <p>The Application offers an optional App Lock feature using Face ID or Touch ID. Biometric authentication is handled entirely by iOS — the Application receives only a pass or fail result and never has access to any biometric data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Location data</h2>
          <p>The Application does not collect or access location information from your device.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Children</h2>
          <p>The Application is not directed to children under the age of 13, and the Service Provider does not knowingly collect information from children. You must be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your information in your country (in some countries a parent or guardian may consent on your behalf).</p>
          <p class="mt-4">If you believe a child has used the Application in a way that raises privacy concerns, please contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:support@smalltalknotebook.com" class="text-[--color-highlight] underline">support@smalltalknotebook.com</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Changes</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted to this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the Application after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="font-title text-2xl text-[--color-contrast] mb-4">Your consent</h2>
          <p>By using the Application, you consent to this Privacy Policy as currently in effect.</p>
        </section>
