## Things You'll Need to Decide

These may come up in the Termly questionnaire — fill in your own answers:

- [ ] **Your legal name or business entity name** (for the "who operates this app" section)
- [ ] **Your country / state** (determines which laws apply — GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- [ ] **Physical mailing address** (some generators ask for this; GDPR may require it)
- [ ] **Whether to include a "Do Not Track" statement** (standard in US-facing policies)
- [ ] **Governing law / jurisdiction** (which country/state's laws govern the policy)
